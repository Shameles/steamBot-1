# PySteam

PySteam is a module that you can use to communicate with the steam market. It is currently under development and it currently has no use yet. Only the login process has been included yet but more will follow.

Things done:
- Login process

Things to do:
- Steam market
- Change profile details
- Clean up code (!)
- Add command-line options

! A lot of the code is unnecessary, but my priority lies somewhere else

Please notice the LICENSE and keep in mind that the module is currently very unstable. It cannot even be called a module yet.

# Usage

There is only one way to use the module now: don't use it as an module. Just open the .py file with Python 3 and scroll down the document and replace the login credentials with your own. Run the script and you will login, there is not much else you can do as of now.
